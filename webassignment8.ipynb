    "No, the Python Standard Library is not included with PyInputPlus. PyInputPlus is a third-party library that provides additional functionality for handling user input in Python. It simplifies the process of getting input from the user and provides features such as input validation, timeout handling, and retrying. However, it does not include the entirety of the Python Standard Library. If you want to use modules or functions from the Python Standard Library, you need to import them separately."

    "\n",
    "When you import a library or module in Python using the import statement, you can provide an alias for that library/module using the as keyword. This allows you to refer to the library/module using the alias instead of its full name. In the case of PyInputPlus, import pyinputplus as pypi allows you to use the shorter alias pypi instead of typing out the full name pyinputplus every time you want to access a function or class from the library."
